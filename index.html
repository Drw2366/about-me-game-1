    <h1>Learning About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kafele Sterling. I'm originally from San Francisco
        CA, but I reside in San Pablo, CA. I have a BA from Clark Atlanta
        University, c/o '00, and my employment background for the last 21 years
        is in broadcast media. I've done almost everyting technical from
        editing, videography, audio operations, master control operations, and directing.
        For the last few years i've been intrigued by what makes computers and software function
        give them their look so I decided to join a bootcamp at Pivot Tech School
        and learn.
